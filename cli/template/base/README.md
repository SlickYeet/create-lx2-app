# Create Lx2 App

This is a [Lx2 Stack](https://create.lx2.dev) project bootstrapped with
`create-lx2-app`.

## Where do I go from here?

You can treat this project just as you would a regular `create-next-app`
project, but without needing to implement additional packages yourself. This
means you can start scaffolding from our base template.

To start developing simply run the following commands:

```bash
cd your-project-name

npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```
