# Getting Started

It is really simple to get started with the TNT-Powered Stack. All you need to
do is to run the following command, and answer the prompts:

## Installation

```bash
npm create tnt-stack@latest
```

It is as simple as that. Once you have answered all the prompts, you can
checkout the [First Steps](/first-steps) section to learn more about how to use
the TNT Stack.

## Advanced Installation

The CLI comes with several flags that can be used to customize the installation
process, or skip certain prompts.

| Flags             | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[dir]`           | The name of the application, as well as the name of the directory to create.   |
| `--noGit`         | Explicitly tell the CLI to not initialize a new git repo in the project.       |
| `--noInstall`     | Generate project without installing dependencies.                              |
| `-y`, `--default` | Bypass the CLI and bootstrap a new TNT Stack project with all options selected |

## Experimental CI flags

The CI flag can be used to scaffold a new project without prompts. This is
useful for CI/CD pipelines.

| Flags                        | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--CI`                       | Set the CLI to run in CI mode.                             |
| `--backend [framework]`      | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with the chosen backend. |
| `--authProvider [provider]`  | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with an auth provider    |
| `--databaseORM [orm]`        | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with a database ORM      |
| `--formatter [formatter]`    | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with a formatter         |
| `--linter [linter]`          | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with a linter            |
| `-i, --import-alias [alias]` | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with Import Alias.       |
| `--dbProvider [provider]`    | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with a database.         |

<Callout type="warning">
  If you donâ€™t provide the CI flag, the rest of these flags have no effect.
</Callout>

### Examples

Most flags will require a value, you can pass the value after the flag. For
example, to scaffold a project with a Prisma, you would run:

```bash
npm create tnt-stack@latest --CI --databaseORM prisma
```
