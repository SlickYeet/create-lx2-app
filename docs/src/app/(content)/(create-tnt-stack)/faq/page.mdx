# FAQ

Some of the most commonly asked questions about the `Create TNT Stack` project.

## What is TNT Stack?

TNT Stack is a collection of open-source tools and libraries, designed to help
developers build and deploy applications quickly and efficiently. Some of the
key components of TNT Stack include:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Auth.js
- Prisma

## How do I actually use TNT Stack?

Overthinking it is natural when having many options. I recommend you to start
with the scaffolding setup by Create TNT Stack. From there, you can start
building your application and adding features as you go.

The goal of TNT Stack is to provide you with a solid foundation to build upon,
so you can focus on building your application, rather than worrying about the
underlying technologies.

if you are not familiar with the technologies used in TNT Stack, I recommend you
take some time to learn about them.

| Technology                                    | Description                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.   |
| [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)                | The React Framework for the Web.                  |
| [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)      | A utility-first CSS framework.                    |
| [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)                | Authentication for the Web. Free and open source. |
| [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)              | A database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.    |

## Why are there `.js` files in the project?

Since TypeScript is one of the core technologies used in the TNT Stack, this is
a question that comes up often. The reason for the `.js` files is that not all
frameworks and libraries support TypeScript.

## What learning resources are available for TNT Stack?

Because TNT Stack is built on top of popular technologies like TypeScript,
Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, there are many resources available to help you learn
these technologies. Some of the best resources include:

- [Theo (Creator of Create T3 App)](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg)
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

Of course, the best way to learn is by doing. So, I recommend you start building
your own projects using TNT Stack.

Alternatively, you can also check out the [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg)
project for other resources and examples of how to use modern web technologies
together.
