# Introduction

## The TNT-Powered Stack

As you may have guessed, the `TNT-Powered` Stack is based on the oh-so-popular
tech stack that is primarily comprised of the follwing:

- [**T**ypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [**N**ext.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**T**ailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

These technologies are the backbone of the stack, but it also includes a few of
the most popular libraries and tools in the javascript, and more secifically,
the Next.js/React ecosystem. Some of these libraries include:

- [**NextAuth**](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/)
- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/)
- [**Payload CMS**](https://payloadcms.com/)

This stack has been gaining popularity in the web development community for its
ease of use, developer experience, and performance. It is a great choice for
building web applications, and websites, and it is the reason for the creation
of this tool.

## What is create-tnt-stack?

If you are aware of the
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation)
tool (I hope you are...), then you can think of `create-tnt-stack` as an
extension of that tool.

I built `create-tnt-stack` to help developers get started with the TNT-Powered
stack as quickly as possible. It is a simple command line tool that generates a
new Next.js project with all the necessary configurations, and tools that are
required to get started with the stack.

Additionally, during the project creation process, you will be prompted to
choose from a list of technologies that you might want to include in your
project. The tool includes some of the most popular libraries and tools in the
Next.js/React ecosystem, so you can choose the ones that you are most
comfortable with.

## Axioms

This tool leans heavily on the core principles of the
[T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), and if you look closely, you will see that it
is heavily inspired by it. I believe that the T3 Stack is a great starting point
for building web applications, and websites, but I found that it was missing
some libraries and tools that I use on a daily basis.

### Solve the common problems

Different from how the T3 Stack approaches the problem, I wanted to create a
tool that <i>does</i>
[`add everything`](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#solve-problems). Of
course, I will not be adding every library and tool that exists in the
javascript ecosystem, but I will be adding the ones that I find most useful, and
that I believe will help developers get started right, and as quickly as
possible.

### Keeping it simple

Now this is a tricky one, considering some of the packages I have chosen to
include. But I believe that even the most complex of tools can be simple to use.
Most packages will only come with the initial configuration to get you up and
running.

{/* <Callout type="info"> */} You are expected to implement your own logic or
configuration as you see fit. {/* </Callout> */}

### Developer experience

In my humble opinion, as a developer ðŸ§‚, the most important thing is the
developer experience. I believe that if a tool is easy to use, and understand,
then it is a good tool. I have tried to make this tool as easy to use as
possible, and I hope that you find it useful.

### Lastly, typesafety isn't optional

I share the same sentiment as the maintainers of the T3 Stack, and I believe
that
[Typesafety Isnâ€™t Optional](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#typesafety-isnt-optional).
Create TNT Stack is built with TypeScript, and it is one of the core
technologies in the stack. It is also a tool to quickly scaffold full-stack
applications, therefore I believe that typesafety is a must.
