# Prisma ORM

[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) is a modern database toolkit that
simplifies database access and management in Node.js and TypeScript
applications.

## Prisma Client

The Prisma Client is a type-safe query builder that's generated based on your
Prisma schema. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations on your database in a type-safe manner.

**Importing the Prisma Client:**

In TNT-Powered applications, the Prisma Client is initialized and made available
globally. You can import the client from the `@/server/db` module.

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

import { env } from "@/env"

const createPrismaClient = () =>
  new PrismaClient({
    log:
      env.NODE_ENV === "development"
        ? [
            // "query",
            "error",
            "warn",
          ]
        : ["error"],
  })

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: ReturnType<typeof createPrismaClient> | undefined
}

export const db = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? createPrismaClient()

if (env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = db
```

The `PrismaClient` instance, exported as `db`, manages database access and logs
errors and warnings by default. To enable query logs, uncomment `"query"` in the
`log` array.

<Callout type="warning" title="Caution with Query Logs">
  Query logs can expose sensitive data, such as passwords. They are also very
  verbose and tend to spam the console.
</Callout>

**Basic CRUD Operations:**

- Create:

```ts
const newPost = await db.post.create({
  data: {
    id: "1",
    title: "New Post",
    content: "This is a new post.",
  },
})
console.log(newPost)
```

- Read:

```ts
const posts = await db.post.findMany({})
console.log(posts)

const post = await db.post.findUnique({
  where: { id: "1" },
})
console.log(post)
```

- Update:

```ts
const updatedPost = await db.post.update({
  where: { id: "1" },
  data: { title: "Updated Post" },
})
console.log(updatedPost)
```

- Delete:

```ts
const deletedPost = await db.post.delete({
  where: { id: "1" },
})
console.log(deletedPost)
```

**Disconnecting the Client:**

It's good practice to disconnect the Prisma Client when you're done using it,
especially in serverless environments.

```ts
async function main() {
  // ... your Prisma Client operations
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

  your database.

## Schema

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file defines your database schema. This file contains
a few models, depending on your feature selection during the initialization
process. It also specifies:

- **Data source:** The database provider (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
- **Connection URL:** The URL used to connect to your database.
- **Data model:** The structure of your tables, including fields, data types,
  and relations.

The default schema for a TNT-Powered application when initialized with Prisma:

```prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
    provider = "sqlite"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
    id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    name      String
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

    @@index([name])
}

```

**Key Concepts:**

- `generator`: Configures how Prisma Client is generated
- `datasource`: Defines the database connection
- `model`: Represents a database table
- `fields`: Define the columns within a table with their datatypes and
  constraints
- `@id`: Marks a field as the primary key
- `@default`: Specifies a default value for a field
- `@unique`: Enforces uniqueness for a field
- `@relation`: Defines relationships between models (tables)

## Migrate

Prisma Migrate is a tool for managing database schema changes. It allows you to:

- Create migrations based on changes in your Prisma schema
- Apply migrations to your database
- Track the history of schema changes

**Common Commands:**

- `npm db:migrate dev`: Create a migration from changes in Prisma schema, apply
  it to the database, trigger generators (e.g. Prisma Client)
- `npm db:migrate reset`: Reset your database and apply all migrations (use with
  caution in production)
- `npm db:migrate deploy`: Apply pending migrations to the database in
  production/staging
- `npm db:migrate status`: Check the status of migrations in the
  production/staging database
- `npm db:migrate resolve`: Resolve issues with database migrations, i.e.
  baseline, failed migration, hotfix
- `npm db:migrate diff`: Compare the database schema from two arbitrary sources

**Workflow:**

1. Modify your `prisma/schema.prisma` file.
2. Run `npm db:migrate dev --name <migration-name>` to create a new migration.
3. Prisma will generate SQL migration files in the `prisma/migrations`
   directory.
4. Apply the migrations to your database.

## Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio is a GUI for viewing and manipulating data in your database. It
allows you to:

- Browse your data
- Create, update, and delete records
- Filter and sort data
- View relationships between tables

**Running Prisma Studio:**

```bash
npm db:studio
```

This will return a URL (usually `http://localhost:5555`) where you can access
Prisma Studio in your web browser.
