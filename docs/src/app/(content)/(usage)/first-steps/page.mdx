# What's Next?

Now that you have created your TNT-Powered project, you can start building your
application. Here are some resources to help you get started:

## Database

### MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite

If you have chosen to use a database with your project, you need to populate the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.

```shell copy
# The connection string should look something like this:
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"
```

You can choose to run your database locally, using a service like
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), or use a cloud service like
[Neon](https://neon.tech/). Alternatively, you can use SQLite for local
development. SQLite is the default database for TNT-Powered projects, and no
additional setup is required to get started.

### Prisma

We recommend using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to interact with your
database. Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes it easy to interact
with your database using TypeScript. If you chose to include Prisma ensure you
run the following commands to push your schema to your database and generate
your Prisma client.

```shell copy
npm db:push
npm postinstall
```

### Drizzle

{/* <Callout type="default"> */} Drizzle is not yet available in TNT-Powered
projects. {/* </Callout> */}

Drizzle will be available in the future to help you manage your database schema
and migrations. Drizzle cannot be used at the same time as Prisma, so you will
need to choose one or the other.

## Authentication

### NextAuth.js

When using NextAuth.js, we have included the `DiscordProvider` by default. It is
one of the simplest ways to add authentication to your application. However, it
still needs some initial setup.

If you wish to use another provider, you can find a list of all the NextAuth.js
providers [here](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/).

1. Of course, you need a Discord account, so register one if you don't already
   have one.
2. Navigate to the
   [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and
   create a new application, by clicking on the "New Application" button.
3. Give your application a name and click `Create`.
4. Head to the `OAuth2` section and copy the `Client ID` to your `.env` file.
5. Next click `Reset Secret`, then copy the `Client Secret` to your `.env` file.
6. Next, click `Add Redirect` and type the URL of you application followed by
   `/api/auth/callback/discord`.
   - In development, this will be
     `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`.
   - In production, this will be
     `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/discord`.
7. Finally, save your changes.

Now you should be able to sign in with Discord.

## Extensions

We recommend using the following extensions for an optimal development
experience.

- [Prisma Extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/development-environment/editor-setup)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup)
- [Prettier Extension](https://prettier.io/docs/editors.html)

## Start Building

- Take a look around the project structure and familiarize yourself with the
  codebase.
- Read the docs to learn more details about the project and how to use it.
- Start building your application!
