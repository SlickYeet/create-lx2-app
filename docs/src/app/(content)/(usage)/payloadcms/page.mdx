# Payload CMS

## Why I chose Payload

First I would like to explain why I chose to use Payload to add to the stack.
Payload was my first choice, because it is open-source, self-hosted, has a great
developer experience, and has a great community.

I first came across Payload when I was looking for a headless Next.js CMS for my
personal portfolio. I originally did not end up using it, because I was
overwhelmed by the amount of options available. I wanted to quickly get
something up and running, and I ended up hardcoding the content into my site,
which was a mistake.

When I started working on the second version of my portfolio
[(my current one)](https://lasse.famlam.ca), I decided to give Payload a try. I
was blown away by how easy it was to set up and use. The documentation is great,
and the community is very helpful. I was able to get up and running in no time,
and I was could focus on building the site and writing content instead of
worrying about the CMS.

## What is Payload?

Payload is a headless open-source CMS natively built for Next.js. It has full
support for TypeScript, and is fully typesafe. Its main focus is on providing a
flexible and developer-friendly experience with features such as:

- **Payload is Next.js native**: Payload is built on Next.js, ensuring less
  hassle, more speed, and enhancing your projects from the ground up.
- **Customizable Content Modeling**: Define your schema in code and get a full
  TypeScript backend and admin panel. Instantly.
- **Fully Leverage React Server Components**: Extend your admin panel with
  server components, reducing client-side load and keeping business logic behind
  the scenes.
- **Turbopack Out of Box**: Payload supports Turbopack from the start,
  accelerating development with instant updates and a superior developer
  experience.
- **Deploy Serverlessly**: A Next.js foundation allows effortless deploy of your
  full stack to serverless platforms like Vercel, streamlining your workflow and
  boosting scalability.
- **Harmonious Front and Back-End Deployment**: Bring your front and back-end
  together in perfect harmony, simplifying deployment and enhancing
  collaboration across your entire stack.

## How to use Payload

<Callout type="info">
  This guide is not meant to be a full tutorial on how to use Payload. It is
  just a quick overview to get you started. For more complete information,
  please check out the [official
  documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-payload).
</Callout>

### Payload config

The `payload.config.ts` file is where all the magic happens. It is a fully-typed
JavaScript object that can be infinitely extended upon. It is also where you
configure your Payload instance. Everything from your Database choice to the
appearance of the Admin Panel is configured there.

The config is typically located in the root of your project along with the
`next.config.mjs` file. Below you can see an example of the simplest possible
Payload config:

```ts showLineNumbers title="payload.config.ts"
import { postgresAdapter } from "@payloadcms/db-postgres"
import { buildConfig } from "payload"

export default buildConfig({
  secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET,
  db: postgresAdapter({
    pool: {
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    },
  }),
  collections: [
    {
      slug: "posts",
      fields: [
        {
          name: "title",
          type: "text",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

See
[Payload config overview](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview)
for more information and examples of the config.

### Database

Payload support a variety of databases, including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and
SQLite.

To configure a Database adapter, use the `db` property in the config.

```ts {6-10} showLineNumbers title="payload.config.ts"
import { postgresAdapter } from "@payloadcms/db-postgres"
import { buildConfig } from "payload"

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  db: postgresAdapter({
    pool: {
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    },
  }),
})
```

See [Payload database overview](https://payloadcms.com/docs/database/overview)
for more information and examples of the database adapters.

### Collections

A collection is a group of records, called Documents, that share the same
structure. For example, a blog post collection would have a title, body, and
author field. To define a collection, use the `collections` property in the
config.

```ts {5-7} showLineNumbers title="payload.config.ts"
import { buildConfig } from "payload"

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  collections: [
    // Your Collections go here
  ],
})
```

Generally, you will want to create a Collection in a separate file, and import
it into the config. This keeps your config file clean and easy to read.

```ts showLineNumbers title="collections/posts.ts"
import type { CollectionConfig } from "payload"

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: "posts",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      type: "text",
    },
    {
      name: "body",
      type: "richText",
    },
    {
      name: "author",
      type: "relationship",
      relationTo: "users",
    },
  ],
}
```

```ts {7-10} showLineNumbers title="payload.config.ts"
import { buildConfig } from "payload"

import { posts } from "./collections/posts"

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  collections: [
    posts,
    // Other Collections go here
  ],
})
```

See
[Payload collections overview](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections)
for more information and examples of collections.

<Callout type="info">
  If your Collection is only meant to contain a single Document (e.g. a Footer),
  you can use a [`Global`](#globals) instead.
</Callout>

### Globals

Globals are very similar to [Collections](#collections), but they are meant to
be used for a single Document.

For example, a Footer or a Header would be a good condidate for a Global. To
define a Global, use the `globals` property in the config.

```ts {5-7} showLineNumbers title="payload.config.ts"
import { buildConfig } from "payload"

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  globals: [
    // Your Globals go here
  ],
})
```

The same way you would create a Collection in a separate file, you can create a
Global in a separate file, and import it into the config.

```ts {7-10} showLineNumbers title="payload.config.ts"
import { buildConfig } from "payload"

import { footer } from "./globals/footer"

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  globals: [
    footer,
    // Other Globals go here
  ],
})
```

See
[Payload globals overview](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/globals)
for more information and examples of globals.

### Fields

Fields are the building blocks of your Collections and Globals. They define the
structure of your Documents. Payload has many built-in fields, but you can also
create your own custom fields.

To define a field, use the `fields` property in the Collection or Global config.

```ts {6-8} showLineNumbers title="collections/posts.ts"
import { Text } from "@payloadcms/fields"
import type { CollectionConfig } from "payload"

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  fields: [
    // ...
  ],
}
```

### APIs

Payload gives you access to three different APIs:

- **Local API**: Extremely fast, direct-to-database access
- **REST API**: Standard HTTP endpoints for querying and mutating data
- **GraphQL API**: A full GraphQL API with a GraphQL Playground

<Callout type="warning">
  This guide will not cover the APIs in detail. For more information, please
  check out how to [retrieve
  data](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/concepts#retrieving-data)
  using Payload.
</Callout>

The Local API is strongly typed and the fastest way to access your data, but it
is only available in the app itself. If you need to access your data from
outside the app, you can use the REST or the GraphQL APIs.

Here is a quick example of how to use each API:

```ts showLineNumbers title="Local API"
import config from "@payload-config"
import { getPayload } from "payload"

async function MyServerComponent() {
  const payload = await getPayload({ config })

  const posts = await payload.find({
    collection: "posts",
  })

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.docs.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.body}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```ts showLineNumbers title="REST API"
async function MyServerComponent() {
  const res = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/posts")
  const posts = await res.json()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.body}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Since the GraphQL API is much more complex, this guide will not cover it. To
  learn how to use it, please check out the [GraphQL API
  documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/graphql/overview).
