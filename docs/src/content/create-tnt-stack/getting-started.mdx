# Getting Started

It is really simple to get started with the TNT Stack. All you need to do is to
run the following command, and answer the prompts:

## Installation

### npm

```bash copy
npm create tnt-stack@latest
```

### yarn

```bash copy
yarn create tnt-stack
```

### pnpm

```bash copy
pnpm create tnt-stack@latest
```

### bun

```bash copy
bun create tnt-stack@latest
```

It is as simple as that. Once you have answered all the prompts, you can
checkout the [First Steps](/docs/usage/first-steps) section to learn more about
how to use the TNT Stack.

## Advanced Installation

The CLI comes with several flags that can be used to customize the installation
process, or skip certain prompts.

| Flags             | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[dir]`           | The name of the application, as well as the name of the directory to create.   |
| `--noGit`         | Explicitly tell the CLI to not initialize a new git repo in the project.       |
| `--noInstall`     | Generate project without installing dependencies.                              |
| `-y`, `--default` | Bypass the CLI and bootstrap a new TNT Stack project with all options selected |

## Experimental CI flags

The CI flag can be used to scaffold a new project without prompts. This is
useful for CI/CD pipelines.

| Flags                          | Description                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--CI`                         | Set the CLI to run in CI mode.                       |
| `--nextAuth`                   | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with NextAuth.js.  |
| `--prisma`                     | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with Prisma.       |
| `--prettier`                   | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with Prettier.     |
| `-I`, `--import-alias [alias]` | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with Import Alias. |
| `--dbProvider [provider]`      | Set the CLI to scaffold a project with a database.   |

<Callout type="warning">
  If you donâ€™t provide the CI flag, the rest of these flags have no effect.
</Callout>

### Examples

Unless specified otherwise, all flags are boolean flags. This mean that they
don't require a value to be passed to them. For example, to scaffold a project
with NextAuth.js, you would run:

```bash copy
npm create tnt-stack@latest --CI --nextAuth
```

For flags that require a value, you would pass the value after the flag. For
example, to scaffold a project with a database provider, you would run:

```bash copy
npm create tnt-stack@latest --CI --dbProvider postgresql
```
