  Get started with the Lx2 stack, the best way to build your next web

It is really simple to get started with the Lx2 stack. All you need to do is to
run the following command, and answer the prompts:

## Installation

```bash
npm create lx2-app@latest
```

It is as simple as that. Once you have answered all the prompts, you can
checkout the [First Steps](/docs/first-steps) section to learn more about how to
use the Lx2 App.

## Advanced Installation

The CLI comes with several flags that can be used to customize the installation
process, or skip certain prompts.

| Flags             | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[dir]`           | The name of the application, as well as the name of the directory to create.          |
| `--git`           | Whether the CLI should initialize a new git repo in the project.                      |
| `--install`       | Generate project installing dependencies.                                             |
| `-y`, `--default` | Bypass the CLI and bootstrap a new Lx2 App project with all default options selected. |

## Experimental CI flags

The CI flag can be used to scaffold a new project without prompts. This is
useful for CI/CD pipelines.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't provide the CI flag, the rest of these flags have no effect.
</Callout>

| Flags                        | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--CI`                       | Set the CLI to run in CI mode.                    |
| `--backend [framework]`      | Specify which backend framework to scaffold with. |
| `--authProvider [provider]`  | Specify which auth provider to scaffold with.     |
| `--databaseORM [orm]`        | Specify which orm to scaffold with.               |
| `--formatter [formatter]`    | Specify which formatter to scaffold with.         |
| `--linter [linter]`          | Specify which linter to scaffold with.            |
| `-i, --import-alias [alias]` | Specify which import alias to scaffold with.      |
| `--dbProvider [provider]`    | Specify which database engine to scaffold with.   |

### Examples

Most flags will require a value, which can be passed in after the flag. For
example, to scaffold a project with Prisma, you would run:

```bash
npm create lx2-app@latest --CI --databaseORM prisma
```

You can use the CI flags to skip the entire prompt process like this:

```bash
npm create lx2-app@latest my-app \
  --CI \
  --backend nextjs \
  --authProvider authjs \
  --databaseORM prisma \
  --dbProvider postgresql \
  --linter eslint/prettier
```
