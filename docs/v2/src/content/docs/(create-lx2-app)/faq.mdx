Some of the most commonly asked questions about the `Create Lx2 App` project.

## What is Lx2 App?

Lx2 App is a collection of open-source tools and libraries, designed to help
developers build and deploy applications quickly and efficiently. Some of the
key components of Lx2 App include:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Auth.js
- Prisma

## How do I actually use Lx2 App?

Overthinking it is natural when having many options. I recommend you to start
with the scaffolding setup by Create Lx2 App. From there, you can start building
your application and adding features as you go.

The goal of Lx2 App is to provide you with a solid foundation to build upon, so
you can focus on building your application, rather than worrying about the
underlying technologies.

if you are not familiar with the technologies used in Lx2 App, I recommend you
take some time to learn about them.
