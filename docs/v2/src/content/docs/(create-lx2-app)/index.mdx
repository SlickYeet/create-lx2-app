## The Lx2 Stack

The Lx2 stack is based on the oh-so-popular `TNT` tech stack. It is comprised of
the below technologies, which are the backbone of `create-lx2-app`:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The stack also includes a few of the most popular libraries and tools in the
JavaScript, and more specifically, the Next.js/React ecosystem. This following
list is still growing as I discover more libraries I want to include.

- **Authentication**
  - [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)
  - [BetterAuth](https://www.better-auth.com/)
- **ORM**
  - [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
  - [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Linting & Formatting**
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- **Backend**
  - [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/)

## What is create-lx2-app?

If you are aware of the
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation)
tool (I hope you are...), then you can think of `create-lx2-app` as an extension
of that tool.

I started `create-lx2-app` primarily for myself. It is a command line interface
that generates a new Next.js project with highly opinionated defaults and
configurations. When running the CLI you will be prompted to choose from the
above list of technologies that you might want to include.

## Axioms

This tool leans heavily on the core principles of the
[T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), and if you look closely, you will see that it
is heavily inspired by it. I believe that the T3 Stack is a great starting point
for building web applications, and websites. However, I found that I had
different opinions on project setup and configuration, hence why I created
`create-lx2-app`.

### Solve the common problems

Different from how the T3 Stack approaches the problem, I wanted to create a
tool that _does_
[`add everything`](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#solve-problems). Of
course, I will not be adding every library and tool that exists. However, I will
be adding the ones that I find most useful and that will help to get started
right and quickly.

### Keeping it simple

Now this is a tricky one, considering some of the packages I have chosen to
include. But most packages will only come with the initial configuration to get
you up and running. `create-lx2-app` is NOT meant to be a one-size-fits-all
solution. Instead it is a highly opinionated starting point.

<Callout type="info">
  You are expected to implement your own logic as you see fit.
</Callout>

### Developer experience

If the developer experience is bad, then the tool is bad. This is a very
subjective statement, but one that I strongly believe in. I believe that if a
tool is easy to use, and understand, then it is a good tool. I have tried to
make this tool as easy to use as possible, and I hope that you find it useful.

### Lastly, typesafety is NOT optional

I share the same sentiment as the maintainers of the T3 Stack, and I believe
that
[Typesafety Isn't Optional](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#typesafety-isnt-optional).
`create-lx2-app` is built with TypeScript, and it is one of the core
technologies in the stack, therefore I believe that typesafety is a must.
