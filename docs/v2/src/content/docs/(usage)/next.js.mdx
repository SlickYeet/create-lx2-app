Check out
[Theo's Next.js Conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UhNo3HAMw) to get a
better understanding of what Next.js is and how it works.

## Why should I use it?

Next.js is a modern full-stack React framework used at companies like `Vercel`,
`Netflix`, `TikTok`, and more. It simplifies building web apps by providing a
unified solution for both the frontend and backend, all while leveraging the
power of React and TypeScript.

It provides features like:

- **Great DX:** Built-in features like routing, image optimization, and Hot
  Module Replacement (HMR) make building apps fun.
- **Full-stack Ready:** Use server functions, API routes, and more without
  needing a separate backend framework.
- **Fast by Default:** Next.js includes performance optimizations out of the
  box.
- **Flexible:** Works for static sites, SSR (server-side rendered), and even
  hybrid apps.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** A large community and ecosystem of plugins,
  libraries, and tools to extend functionality.
- **Integrations:** Seamless integration with Vercel for deployment, as well as
  support for other hosting providers.

IT extends what React can do by giving you:

- File-based routing
- Built-in API routes
- Full support for static generation and server-side rendering
- App Router and app directory structure (in Next.js 13+)
- And much more!

<Callout type="warning">
Create Lx2 App exclusively uses the `App Router` and does not support the `Pages Router`.

This was a choice made to ensure that we can take advantage of the latest
features, and to simplify the development experience.
