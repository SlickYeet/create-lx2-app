Next.js is a popular full-stack framework build on top of React.

Check out
[Theo's Next.js Conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UhNo3HAMw) to get a
better understanding of what Next.js is and how it works.

## Why should I use it?

Next.js is a modern full-stack React framework that allows you to build modern
web applications with ease, and it's the base framework for `Create TNT Stack`.

It provides features link:

- **Great DX:** Built-in features like routing, image optimization, and fast
  refresh make building apps fun again.
- **Full-stack Ready:** Use server functions, API routes, and more without
  needing a separate backend framework.
- **Fast by Default:** Next.js includes performance optimizations out of the
  box.
- **Flexible:** Works for static sites, SSR (server-side rendered), and even
  hybrid apps.

IT extends what React can do by giving you:

- File-based routing
- Built-in API routes
- Full support for static generation and server-side rendering
- App Router and app directory structure (in Next.js 13+)
- And much more!

<Callout type="warning">
Create TNT Stack exclusively uses the `App Router` and does not support the `Pages Router`.

This was a choice made to ensure that we can take advantage of the latest
features, and to simplify the development experience.
