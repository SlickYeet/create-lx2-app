description: Moving your TNT-Powered project into development.
---

Now that you have created your TNT-Powered project, you can start building your
application. Here are some resources to help you get started:

## Database

### MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite

If you have chosen to use a database with your project, you need to populate the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.

```bash title=".env"
# The connection string should look something like this:
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"
```

You can choose to run your database locally, using a service like
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), or use a cloud service like
[Neon](https://neon.tech/). Alternatively, you can use SQLite for local
development. SQLite is the default database for TNT-Powered projects, and no
additional setup is required to get started.

### Prisma

We recommend using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to interact with your
database. Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes it easy to interact
with your database using TypeScript. If you chose to include Prisma ensure you
run the following commands.

<CodeBlock code="npm run db:push && npm run postinstall" />

The above command will:

- Push your prisma schema to your database, creating the necessary tables and
  relationships.
- Generate the Prisma client, which is used to interact with your database in
  your application code, in a type-safe manner.

<Callout type="info">
  The `postinstall` script in your package.json runs `prisma generate`, and will
  automatically run after installing dependencies.
</Callout>

### Drizzle

<Callout type="warning">
  Drizzle is not yet available in TNT-Powered projects.
</Callout>

Drizzle will be available in the future to help you manage your database schema
and migrations. Drizzle cannot be used at the same time as Prisma, so you will
need to choose one or the other.

## Authentication

### Auth.js and Better Auth

For authentication, you can choose between the two below libraries. Both
libraries are great options, but they have different features and capabilities.

- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)
- [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)

Auth.js is a great option if you want a simple and easy-to-use authentication
library. It has a lot of built-in providers and is easy to set up. Better Auth
is a more customizable option that allows you to extend your authentication flow
with many different plugins.

A list of all the providers for both libraries can be found below:

- [Auth.js Providers](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth)
- [Better Auth Providers](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/discord)

<Callout type="default" title="Note">
  Better Auth does not have a dedicated page for providers, but you can find
  them in the docs under the `Authentication` section in the sidebar.
</Callout>

#### Setup

<Callout type="info">The setup for both libraries is the same</Callout>

By default, create-lx2-app will set up Discord as the authentication provider,
so:

1. Of course, you need a Discord account, so register one if you don't already
   have one.
2. Navigate to the
   [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and
   create a new application, by clicking on the "New Application" button.
3. Give your application a name and click `Create`.
4. Head to the `OAuth2` section and copy the `Client ID` to your `.env` file.
5. Next click `Reset Secret`, then copy the `Client Secret` to your `.env` file.
6. Next, click `Add Redirect` and type the URL of you application followed by
   `/api/auth/callback/discord`.
   - In development, this will be
     `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`.
   - In production, this will be
     `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/discord`.
7. Finally, save your changes.

Now you should be able to sign in with Discord.

## Extensions

We recommend using the following extensions for an optimal development
experience.

- [Prisma Extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/development-environment/editor-setup)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup)
- [Prettier Extension](https://prettier.io/docs/editors.html)

## Start Building

- Take a look around the project structure and familiarize yourself with the
  codebase.
- Read the docs to learn more details about the project and how to use it.
- Start building your application!
