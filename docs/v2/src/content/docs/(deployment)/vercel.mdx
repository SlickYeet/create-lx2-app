description: How to deploy your Lx2 App application to Vercel.
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Vercel account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at
  [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
- Git installed and your project committed to GitHub.

## Step 1: Link Your Git Repo

Vercel integrates seamlessly with Git providers.

1.  **Open your dashboard:** Go to
    [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and login if you
    haven't.
2.  **Import a Project:** On your Vercel dashboard, click `Add New...` and
    select `Project` from the dropdown.
3.  **Import Git Repository:** Vercel will ask you to connect a Git repository.
    - If you're deploying a new project, click "Continue with
      GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket" and authorize Vercel to access your repositories.
    - Once authorized, you'll see a list of your repositories. Select the
      repository containing your Lx2 application.

## Step 2: Configure Your Project

Vercel automatically detects Next.js applications and sets up the correct build
configuration. However, there are a few things you might want to review or
configure.

1.  **Project Name:** You can change the project name if needed. This will also
    determine the default Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `my-lx2-app.vercel.app`).
2.  **Root Directory (Optional):** If your Lx2 application is not in the root of
    your repository, you can specify the root directory here.
3.  **Build and Output Settings (Optional):** Vercel's defaults for Next.js are
    usually sufficient.
    - **Build Command:** Vercel will default to `next build`. You typically
      don't need to change this.
    - **Output Directory:** Vercel expects `public` for static assets and
      `.next` for the build output, which it handles automatically.
4.  **Environment Variables:** You can quickly add all your environment
    variables at once:
    - Open your `.env` file, press `Ctrl + A` to select all, then `Ctrl + C` to
      copy.
    - Open the `Environment Variables` dropdown and paste everything into the
      single input field.
    - Vercel will automatically create a new variable for each line.

## Step 3: Deploy

Once you've configured your project, you're ready to deploy.

1.  **Click Deploy:** After reviewing your settings, click the `Deploy` button.
2.  **Deployment Process:** Vercel will now:
    - Clone your Git repository.
    - Install your project dependencies.
    - Run the build command (`next build`).
    - Upload your built application to its global edge network.
    - Assign a unique deployment URL.

## Step 4: Monitor Your Deployment

Vercel provides a real-time log of your deployment process.

1.  **Deployment Logs:** After clicking deploy, you'll be able to see the logs
    in real-time.
2.  **Post Deployment:** Once the deployment is complete, you'll see your
    project was successfully deployed and a link to your deployed application.

## Step 5: Add Your Own Domains (Optional)

To use your own domain for your Next.js application:

1.  **Go to Domains:** From your Vercel project's overview, click on the
    `Domains` button on the right.
2.  **Add a Domain:** Click on `Add Domain`, enter your custom domain name
    (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`) and click `Save`.
3.  **Configure DNS:** Vercel will provide you with DNS records (usually an A
    record and/or a CNAME record) that you need to add to your domain
    registrar's DNS settings.
    - Automatic configuration:
      - You can click the `Configure Automatically` button and follow the
        instructions to automatically set up your DNS records.
    - Manual configuration:
      - **For `yourdomain.com`:** Vercel typically recommends an A record
        pointing to their IP address.
      - **For `www.yourdomain.com` or `sub.yourdomain.com`:** Vercel usually
        suggests a CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`.
      - Simply copy the provided `Name` and `Value` fields for each record, and
        paste them into your domain registrar's DNS settings.
4.  **Verify:** After adding the DNS records, return to Vercel. It might take
    some time for the DNS changes to propagate, but Vercel will automatically
    verify the setup once it's complete.

## Continuous Deployment

One of Vercel's strongest features is continuous deployment. Once your project
is connected:

- Every time you push new commits to your connected Git branch (usually `main`
  or `master`), Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment.
- You'll get a unique preview URL for each commit, allowing you to review
  changes before merging to production.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Build Failures:** Check the deployment logs on Vercel for error messages.
  Common causes include:
  - Missing environment variables.
  - Syntax errors in your Next.js code.
  - Incorrect `package.json` scripts or dependencies.
- **"Page Not Found" Errors:**
  - Ensure your `app` directory is correctly structured.
  - Verify that your Next.js application is indeed in the root directory or that
    you've correctly set the `Root Directory` in Vercel.
- **Slow Deployments:** Large applications or many dependencies can lead to
  longer build times. Consider optimizing your dependencies or using Vercel's
  caching features.

By following these steps, you should have your `create-lx2-app` application
successfully deployed on Vercel and set up for continuous deployment!
