# Better Auth

Better Auth is a authentication framework for TypeScript. It is designed to be
simple and easy to use, while also being powerful and flexible. It does so by
providing a set of basic building blocks that can be used to create your
authentication flow, and a large collection of plugins that can be used to
extend the framework.

## Concepts

To understand how Better Auth works, it is important to understand the concepts
which it is built on. I will only cover the most important ones here, but if you
want to learn more, you can check out the
[documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/api).

### API

The API is the core of Better Auth, you can access it by creating a BetterAuth
instance. In a Create TNT Stack app this step is done for you. The API can be
accessed by importing the `auth` object from `@/server/auth`.

The API exposes a set of methods that can be used to create your authentication
flow. Below you can see an example of how to use the API to get the current
user's session.

```ts
import { headers } from "next/headers"

import { auth } from "@/server/auth"

await auth.api.getSession({
  headers: await headers(),
})
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  You can use the API to create Next.js server actions. Simply export a function
  that uses the `auth.api` object. Ensure the file includes the `"use server"`
  directive.
</Callout>

### Client

The client library is similar to the API, but it is designed to be used with
frontend frameworks like React. It includes a set of methods that can be used to
create your authentication flow. Below you can see an example of how to use the
client library to get the current user's session.

```ts
import { useSession } from "@/src/lib/auth/client"

const {
  data: session,
  isPending, // loading state
  error, // error object
  refetch, // refetch the session
} = useSession()
```

### CLI

The CLI is a powerful, built-in tool to help you manage your database schemas,
and more.

#### Generate

The `generate` command is used to generate the schema required for Better Auth.
When using Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the appropriate schema
for your ORM.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

For more information on the `generate` command, check out the
[CLI documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/cli#generate).

#### Migrate

The `migrate` command is used to apply the generated schema to your database.
This command is only available when you are NOT using an ORM. If you are using
Prisma or Drizzle, you must apply the generated schema using manually using the
provided migration commands.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

For more information on the `migrate` command, check out the
[CLI documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/cli#migrate).

#### Secret

Create TNT Stack will automatically generate a secret for you. However, if you
want to generate a new secret, you can use the `secret` command.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret
```
