# Auth.js v5

Auth.js is the next major version of [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), a
complete rewrite of the original library. It supports the same authentication
flows as NextAuth.js, and it supports over
[80 OAuth providers](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth)
out of the box.

## Why Auth.js?

Auth.js is super simple to use, and to get started with. If you are looking for
a simple way to add authentication to your web app, Auth.js is one of the best
options available. Auth.js supports many adapters like Prisma and Drizzle, and
it is also free and open source.

## Getting started

You can access all methods and properties of Auth.js by importing them from
`@/server/auth`. For example, to get the current user session, you can call the
`auth` function:

```tsx
import { auth } from "@/server/auth"

export default async function Page() {
  const session = await auth()
  const user = session?.user

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome {user?.name}</h1>
      <p>Your email is {user?.email}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

For a working example, scaffold a new app using `Auth.js` and browse through the
files in the `src` directory, specifically the `app/page.tsx` file and
`server/auth` directory, which contain some basic authentication logic.

## Authentication

By default, we have included Discord OAuth, but you can add any of the
[80+ providers](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth) that
Auth.js supports. To configure additional providers, you can add them to the
`providers` array in the `server/auth/config.ts` file.

```ts
import { NextAuthConfig } from "next-auth"
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"

import { env } from "@/env"

export const authConfig: NextAuthConfig = {
  providers: [
    //...other providers
    GitHub({
      clientId: env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
}
```

<Callout type="warning" title="NOTE">
  Do not forget to set the environment variables for your providers. You can add
  them to your `.env` and `src/env.js` files.
</Callout>

## Concepts

For a more in-depth look at the concepts behind Auth.js, check out the
[Auth.js concepts](https://authjs.dev/concepts). Here are some of the most
important concepts:

- **Session Strategies**: Auth.js supports both JWT and database sessions. You
  can choose which one to use based on your needs.
- **Authentication**: Auth.js supports many authentication flows, including
  OAuth, Magic Links, Credentials, and WebAuthn.
- **Database models**: Auth.js can be used with any database, and it supports
  many popular ORMs like Prisma and Drizzle.
